# Introduction

Greetings, Tally!

This is a project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the intent is to provide a proof of concept web application to help customers budget how much they need to save on a down payment for their property.

The feature presents a `Mortgage Calculator` that takes in the following information:
1. Payment period [10, 15, 20, 30, 50] years
2. Interest rate defaulted to the current federal interest +2.5%
3. Principal amount

In addition, the user has the ability to specify:
1. The amount of savings they can set aside each month
2. The number of months they are able to save (being able to choose from 1 month up to 5 years)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
